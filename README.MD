# SJuradoQ (API REST)
A REST API for my personal web(WIP).
Right now it only does Read operations cause I don't need 
more due to [Django Admin console](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/contrib/admin/)
but a whole CRUD would be implemented.

It will contain information about me and a portfolio.

## Requirements
Create a virtualenv and install the following packages:
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) `pip install Django`
* [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/5.2.x/) `pip install Pillow`
* [Django Rest Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) `pip install djangorestframework`

*Once the web is finished I will upload it into this repository.
